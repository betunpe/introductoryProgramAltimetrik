What is GIT?
Git is a free and open-source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. With Git you and your team will be able to have multiple local branches that can be completely independent. 
A Branch is a copy of the original code that hosts in your local machine. In your branches, you can make changes and fix your code for later merging it with the master branch that contains the original code (Merge).
